# Furhat
Before going to the actual project and task at hand, let's first understand what is a social robot. Social robots are a combination of conversational AI and physical robots. This factor makes them very much different from a normal chatbot and avatars. The problem with chatbots or avatars is that they can be called social but they are not physical. Conversely for manufacturing robots, they are physical but not social. The reason for choosing Furhat for this project is, because it is a social robot.
Furhat is a social robot with facial expression like a human and advanced conversational Artificial Intelligence capabilities.
